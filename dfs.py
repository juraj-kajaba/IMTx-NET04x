"""LIFO (Last In, First Out) is a stack where the most recent elements are the first ones to be removed from the stack. In the next cell you can see one of the many possible implementations of LIFO using lists. There are two main functions:

Push: responsable for inserting a new element on the correct position of the stack
Pop: responsable for removing the correct element from the stack"""

"""Depth-First Search (DFS)Â¶
Depth-First search is a traversal/search algorithm for trees and graphs 
that starts at a root vertex and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

Exercise A (1pt)
Complete the DFS function which performs a DFS over a graph using a LIFO stack. 
It receives are the maze map, which is a graph represented in a dictionary, in the 
same way we used in Lab 1 and a starting position. It should return a list with the order 
of executed notes and a dictionary containing the vertexs as the keys and its parents as the value. 
You should not visit the same vertex twice."""
